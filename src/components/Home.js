        <h1>What is Cortadito</h1>
        <p>
          About 71% of Miami’s population identifies as Latin American, but just
          what is a Latin American? What makes up a Latin American? Well, much
          like Miami’s signature coffee, “el cortadito”, it varies. Sure, the
          ingredients may be similar, however, how they are expressed is what
          brings about the uniqueness of every Latin American individual. The
          parts that make the Latinx community so diverse are also the ones that
          bring the community together. However, it’s not without its
          challenges. When people emmigrate from Latin America to the U.S. they
          bring with them their culture and language. Preserving those
          traditions and finding their identities in their new homes can be a
          challenge for many immigrants. Whether the circumstances of their
          arrival is planned or forced, lawfully or unlawfully, moving to a
          foreign land with a new language can be very stressful. It is in
          familiarity that we find comfort, which could be why that percentage
          is so high for Miami. But what if we could help our residentes of
          Miami to prepare them to integrate with the remaining 29% of its
          people? That’s what Cortadito aims to do! Our App is meant to connect
          people from Latin-America to resources available in Miami as well as
          people in the community.
